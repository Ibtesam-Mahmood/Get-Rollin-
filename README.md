# Get Rollin'

An  application  which  locates  places where  users  can find accessible  activities along with their  ratings.  The  main  features  of  this  application were decided upon to maximize the quality of experience and usefulness of the application. This includes a search bar, filters for narrowing results, user reviews and Google sign-incapabilities. Filters allow users to narrow results based on preferences and the type of activity they are looking for. The search bar allows users  to find  more  specific activities in  a  shorter period  of  time. Reviews  were another important consideration for this application. It was determined that the value added by others who have experiencedthe  activities  already, would  be significant. With  reviews  incorporated,  users  would  gain  or  lose confidence  in locations,  ultimately  leading  them  to  a  well-reviewed  activity.  Lastly,  Google  sign-in capabilities  were implemented in Get Rollinâ€™ to allow the user to save their history and  provide reviews for other users to see. 

This application can be compiled through Android Studio.
